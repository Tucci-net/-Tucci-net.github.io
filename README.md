Punk Rock shows and Late-night DND Sessions. Finding the right space to be myself proved challenging so why not do it yourself? Ever since I saw my first blink-182 concert I have fallen in love with the DIY ethics mentality and creating your own niche world, art style, and fitting that right overall feel. If you see me in a corporate atmosphere with a suit and tie with a consultant talking about next quarters profit margins whip out the trench coat and crossbow because that's not me!
